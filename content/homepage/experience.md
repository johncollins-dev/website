      Worked as part of a team to deliver improvements and optimizations to the Calypso Software suite.

      - Implemented Java Microbenchmark Harness in Gradle to monitor code performance.

      - Refactored code and wrote JUnit Tests.

      - Created a new class to parse results from JMH output and compare against benchmark values to check for performance gains and degredations.

      - Cherrypicked commits from upstream and patched client versions of the Calypso Software suite.
