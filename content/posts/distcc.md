Gentoo users will be familiar with the compilation times of 
large applications such as web browsers and IDE's. If they 
read the handbook, they might also be familiar with the 
distributed C/C++ compilation tool called Distcc. This 
tool allows you to distribute compilation jobs across the 
network to other computers at the same time, greatly reducing
the burden of compilation times and slow processors.

## Distcc

This tool works across architectures.
